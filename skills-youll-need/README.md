## Start fresh

This is how I started over in each domain.

**Basics**: grab a new machine and configure it with only the tools you need for your work. Install Vm's and learn unix commands.

**Dev**: do a complete coding project preferably in python.

**Ops**: set up your own devops pipeline and deploy your project into the pipeline

**Sec**: secure your home lan, secure your devops pipeline, check your project for insecure code, take counter mesures against ethical hacking \(check the internet for your name, delete data\), keep only useful internet accounts, change all passwords, use a password manager for all of your passwords.

**Culture**: you can't do this on your own, try to participate in the shift to agile development within your company.
