# Getting Started

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is a state of the art software development approach where everything comes as code. The topic covers different technical domains of the software development lifecycle. A DevSecOps Engineer integrates into agile teams and works within the continuous delivery development process. She/He can administrate the software development pipeline and integrates security tools in the different stages as deployment steps. She/He secures containers in the deployment process and can administrate cloud based nodes. DevSecOps Engineers are highly quality aware and monitor changes, compliance and behaviour \(bugs & vulnerabilities\) of a software project. Important topics of DevSecOps are

1. **Code analysis/Vulnerability analysis.** CSA, SAST, DAST, and Security as Code.
2. **Change management** – increase speed and efficiency by allowing anyone to submit changes, then determine whether the change is good or bad.
3. **Compliance monitoring** – be ready for an audit at any time \(which means being in a constant state of compliance, including gathering evidence of GDPR compliance, PCI compliance, etc.\).
4. **Threat investigation** – identify potential emerging threats with each code update and be able to respond quickly.
5. **Vulnerability assessment** – identify new vulnerabilities with code analysis, then analyse how quickly they are being responded to and patched.
6. **Security training** – train software and IT engineers with guidelines for set routines.

## As an IT Professional, what skills do I need to become a DevSecOps Engineer?

As DevSecOps skills cover a widespread set of IT competences in the following areas.

### Computing Basics

You should know basic unix commands, know how to configure different machines \(OS\). You should have a solid understanding of networking.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Project**: grab a new machine and configure it with only the tools you need for your work. Install Vm's and learn unix commands. Create and monitor your home IoT network.
{% endhint %}

### **Software Development Basics**

Programming skills are important. You should at least know one interpreter language like python very well. Java, JS, Python, PHP, any language skill is good. Very important know the tools. git, IDE's, Database tools etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Project**: create an app in python or javascript \(nodejs\). Try a free coding project.
{% endhint %}

### **Operation Basics**

You should know how the software development lifecycle of bigger projects look like. Steps that are involved, tools. You need to understand container and cloud computing. You should know how to use docker and cloud services such as Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure or OpenStack. You should at least know the basics of container ochestration tools like kubernetes. You should be familiar with infrastructure automation tools like chef, puppet, terraform and ansible, compliance tools like Chef  Inspec or cloud compliance tools such as fugue. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Project idea**: dockerize your app. Use at least one infrastructure automation tool. Set up your own CD/CI server and add your project to it. Create a build pipeline for your app.
{% endhint %}

### **Security**

Understand basic security rules and best practices. How to secure your internal LAN, configure iptables.  Know the OWASP Maturity Model and security recommendations. You should know in detail how to secure web applications and furthermore how to attack web applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Project ideas**: secure your home lan, secure your devops pipeline, check your project for insecure code, take counter measures against ethical hacking \(check the internet for your name, delete data\), keep only useful internet accounts, change all passwords, use a password manager for all of your passwords. 
{% endhint %}

### **Culture**

Unless the culture of a whole teams isn't agile enough, you will never be able to make everything as code. If you work in a big team suggest to get a agile facilitator who could assist you in the process of creating a transparent, self-managed and highly responsible culture in your team.

## As a company, how can I implement a DevSecOps approach?

OWASP defines a DevSecOps Maturity model which is state of the art and the most implemented ​in the industry.
