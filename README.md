description: How to start with DevSecOps
---

# Getting Started

DevSecOps covers skills of three technical domains. A DevSecOps Engineer integrates into agile teams and works within the continuous delivery development process. She/He can administrate the development pipeline and integrates security tools in the different stages as deployment steps. She/He secures containers in the deployment process and can administrate cloud based nodes. 

 Important topics of a DevSecOps are

1. **Code analysis/Vulnerability analysis.** CSA, SAST, DAST, and Security as Code.
2. **Change management** – increase speed and efficiency by allowing anyone to submit changes, then determine whether the change is good or bad.
3. **Compliance monitoring** – be ready for an audit at any time \(which means being in a constant state of compliance, including gathering evidence of GDPR compliance, PCI compliance, etc.\).
4. **Threat investigation** – identify potential emerging threats with each code update and be able to respond quickly.
5. **Vulnerability assessment** – identify new vulnerabilities with code analysis, then analyse how quickly they are being responded to and patched.
6. **Security training** – train software and IT engineers with guidelines for set routines.

OWASP defines a DevSecOps Maturity model which is state of the art and the most implemented ​in the industry.
