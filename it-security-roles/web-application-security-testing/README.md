* **Engineers** who want to become a penetration tester.

## What is Web Application Security Testing?

Web Application Security Testing is actually penetration testing web sites and its methodology consists always of the following steps [web-security-testing-methodology](web-security-testing-methodology/ "mention")

A lot of the mentioned tools have integrated automated testing such as automated checks against vulnerability databases, predefined attack payloads and predefined attacks that one can use out-of-the-box.&#x20;

### Get the tools - Pentesting OS compairison

How to get to the tools? By using an especially for the purpose of penetration testing designed OS. The most popular pentesting OS on the market as of today are listed here. As a pentester, you should have seen an instance of each. Install all of them in virtual machines and play with it. If you plan to certify in pentesting, I recommend to use the OS of the school. EC-Council uses parrot, Offensive-Security kali for instance. BlackArch is the most difficult to manage.

So, to be good at web application security testing, you should know in that exact order: common vulnerabilities and attacks, where to find them, choose a penetration testing OS, know the tools and apply them according to your methodology.

### More methodologies

OWASP has also defined a Web Testing Framework that you can use to conduct a guided pentest. Follow instructions on [https://github.com/owtf/owtf](https://github.com/owtf/owtf)
