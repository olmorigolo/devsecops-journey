# Training Guide

### What Certifications make sense?

The golden one is Offensive Security WEB-300. I have been signed up for it and than had no time to start, so I lost my money. Once you start, time is ticking and you can't pause the training. So make sure you are able to do it in the chosen period (30/60/90 days).



I would recommend to start with some basic tutorials and classes on codered, cybrary or pluralsight. Create your [self-hosted-training-lab](self-hosted-training-lab/ "mention") and start going through the phases of the [web-security-testing-methodology](web-security-testing-methodology/ "mention") and learn the phases and required tools to each phase. Focus on the tools you really like.
