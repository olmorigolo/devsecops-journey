## ETI (Enterprise Theory of Investigation)

### Types of evidence:

volatile: system time, processes, command history, etc.

non volatile: still available fter cutting the power (event logs, partitions, swap file, hidden files, registry)

### Characteristics of Digital Evidence&#x20;

* **Admissible** **Evidence** relevant to the case, act in support of the client presenting it, and be well communicated and non- prejudiced.
* **Authentic** investigators must provide supporting documents regarding the authenticity, accuracy, and integrity of the evidence with details such as source and its relevance to the case. If necessary, they must also furnish details such as author of the evidence or path of transmission.&#x20;
* **Complete** must either prove or disprove the consensual fact in the litigation&#x20;
* **Reliable** extract and handle the evidence while maintaining a record of the tasks performed during the process to prove that the evidence is dependable. Forensic investigation is conducted only on the copies of evidence.&#x20;
* **Believable** present evidence in a clear manner to the jury and obtain expert opinions where necessary

### Best Evidence Rule&#x20;

The best evidence rule is to prevent any alteration of digital evidence, either intentionally or unintentional.

Duplicate will also suffice as evidence under the following conditions:&#x20;

 Original evidence is destroyed due to fire and flood.  Original evidence is destroyed in the normal course of business.&#x20;

 Original evidence is in possession of a third party.
